Attention: don't just install these dotfiles on your machine. Dotfiles are highly personalized and a bunch of settings are only for me, you need to at least change those.


You may want to change your mpv gpu-api and other setting, open mpv.conf

You may want to change your git signingKey, open .gitconfig



choco install adoptopenjdkjre
choco install adoptopenjdk

choco install everything
choco install everythingtoolbar
