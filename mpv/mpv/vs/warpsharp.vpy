            Experimental script for sharpening poorly blurred/starved video.
            This is done through awarpsharp2, which you typically AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.
            Blame the ones who requested I add bleeding-sharp filters.
            I at least try to limit it to keep myself slightly sane.

            If you have any resemblance of sanity, you should not use this.

                                    Decrease for weaker sharpening.
        :param blur:                Controls the number of times to blur the edge mask.
                                    Increase for weaker sharpening.
        :param type:                Controls the type of blur to use.
                                    0 means some kind of 13x13 average.
                                    1 means some kind of 5x5 average.
